Jan:

	Week 1: Revisted previous lectures for Encoders, Spatial Pooler and Hierarchical Temporal Memory. Had first glance at dataset (power consumption).

	Week 2: Forked and cloned neocortexapi repo for understanding and went through documentation. Also tried to deep dive into requirements for projects. 

	Week 3: Practised Scalar Encoder for deriving date and time 

	Week 4: Went through ArrayUtils Functions and changed encoder configs which were incorrect.

February:

	Week 1: Restructed project and read the dataset (small slice of dataset) into List<Dictionary<string,string>> then passed to Scalar Encoder which gave List<Dictionary<string,int[]>> where string is label for prediction and int[] is SDR of date and time. Understood Multi Encoder which can be used for Multisequence Learning.
